## Gravitational-wave Astronomy

* My first introduction to the field was through my Master's thesis project done under the supervision of [Dr. Anand Sengupta](https://iitgn.ac.in/faculty/phy/fac-anand) at IIT Gandhinagar. 
* The project was on testing General Relativity (GR), the best classical theory of gravity we have so far, using the recently detected Gravitational-waves from binary black hole and binary neutron star mergers. Since BBH and BNS mergers are processes that involve extreme gravitational fileds, it offers a wonderful oppurtunity to test GR at this strong-field limit!
* The simplest way one could do this is to see if the GW that we detect behaves as GR predicts it should. Any significant deviations from any of the predictions would suggest that GR needs corrections at those limits!
