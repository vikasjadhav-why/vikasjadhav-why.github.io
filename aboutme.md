Hello! My name is Vikas Jadhav.

As a kid I loved exploring and mapping the night sky through stargazing, now I do it with Gravitational-waves. 

I did my Bachelors and Masters in Physics from the Indian Institue of Science Education and Reseach (IISER) Tirupati and I am currently a Junior Research Fellow at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar.

Some of the things I am interested in are books (mostly fiction), football, geography, cartography, and conversations over coffee.

If you would like to talk about any of these things, feel free to contact me.
